# TRF-Solver
Trust-Region Filter (TRF) solver is developed using the concepts from nonlinear optimisation, derivative-free optimisation and surrogate modelling, and is used to optimise grey-box optimisation problems (a combination of glass-box mathematical models with available derivative information and  black-box models without derivative information).
