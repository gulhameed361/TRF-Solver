# TRF-Solver
The Trust-Region Filter (TRF) solver was developed using concepts from nonlinear optimisation, derivative-free optimisation, and surrogate modelling. It allows users to solve hybrid glass box/black box (i.e., grey box) optimisation problems in which parts of the system are modelled with open, equation-based models (with available derivative information) and parts of the system are black boxes (without derivative details). This trust-region-based method utilises surrogate models that are constructed using external black box evaluations, thus avoiding the direct implementation of the computationally expensive black box models. This is done iteratively, resulting in fewer calls to the computationally expensive external black box functions.
