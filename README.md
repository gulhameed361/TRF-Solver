# TRF-Solver
The Trust-Region Filter (TRF) solver was developed using concepts from nonlinear optimisation, derivative-free optimisation, and surrogate modelling. It allows users to solve grey box optimisation problems in which glass box parts of the problem are modelled with open, equation-based models (with available derivative information) and black box parts of the problem lack derivative information (i.e., only function evaluations are possible). This trust-region-based method utilises surrogate models constructed using external black box evaluations, thus avoiding the direct implementation of the computationally expensive black box models. This is done iteratively using the TRF solver, resulting in fewer calls to the computationally costly external black box functions.

The user is required to provide black-box external functions and the glass-box model. The default values of tuning parameters for the TRF algorithm are implemented, however, the user is sometimes required to change them (via the solver's options) based on sensitivity analysis. 

The solver is implemented in Python using the Pyomo modelling language. The required Python packages are specified in both requirements.txt (for pip users) and environment.yml (for conda users).

Installation
- Download all files in this repository.
- Download/install and open Anaconda Navigator.
- Create a new environment using either:
  a. environment.yml (recommended for conda), or
  b. requirements.txt (for pip users in a virtualenv).
- Select Python 3.8.20 when setting up the environment.
- Activate the environment.
- Open Spyder IDE, then open the Run.py file.
- Scroll to the indicated section and add your grey box optimisation code.

A sample grey box optimisation setup is included in Run.py. Additional problems (used in the manuscript) are provided in problem_set.py and can be copied into Run.py.
